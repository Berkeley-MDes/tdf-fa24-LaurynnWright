This week, I designed a name plate for my desk! I used a laser cutter to fabricate the design after I created it in adobe illustrator. My goal was to become more familiar with the laser cutting equipment, which I did successfully. The name plate turned out well, and I found ways to expidite the process in the future. For example, I learned new short cuts for panning and zooming in Adobe Illustrator.
