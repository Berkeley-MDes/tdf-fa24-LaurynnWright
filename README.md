This week, I designed a name plate for my desk! I used a laser cutter to fabricate the design after I created it in Adobe Illustrator. My goal was to become more familiar with the laser cutting equipment and associated software, which I did successfully. The name plate is shown here:

While name plate turned out well, I found ways to expidite the process in the future. For example, I learned new short cuts for panning and zooming in Adobe Illustrator. Holding the spacebar while clicking with the mouse or touch pad allows for panning, while holding alt and scrolling with the mouse or touch pad allows for zooming in and out. While using the laser cutter, I noticed that the process was slower than anticipated. The total run time was 55 minutes and 43 seconds. However, I realized at least one way to reduce the time. There was a white square background behind the "B" in the name plate. As the laser cutter etched the larege "B" the laser would travel nearly an inch past the actual etching points to what looked like the edges of the background box. This wasted time with unnecessary travel and could be fixed by removing the bounding box for future projects. 

When deciding what to make, I wanted to use cutting, etching, and rastering operations to become familar with each process. I also chose to use both images and text in my illustater file to learn how to properly convert each format to the proper format required by the laser cutters. I was able to find a template for a name plate here, which I subsequently customized. The example was made with acrylic, but I used wood for my project. When assembling it, it was difficult to fit the pieces together, but I was eventually able to struggle the wood into the slots. I noticed this poster in the laser cutting room, which I may use in the future to test different joining methods and tolerances.
